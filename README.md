# tmuxcator
A script to manage tmux like [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator).

## Why?
I found solutions like [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator) overengineered and offer alot compared to my simple needs.

So i made this script with the absulotely worse language to do with :).
